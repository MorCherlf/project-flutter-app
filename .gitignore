# Firebase specific
# This file contains project-specific Firebase configurations and is generally safe to commit
# IF it doesn't contain any sensitive secrets directly embedded by you.
# However, some teams prefer to keep it out of version control if they manage configurations differently
# or if the file gets auto-generated/modified often by tools in a way that causes merge conflicts.
# If you download it from Firebase console and it's standard, it's usually okay.
